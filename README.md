# 📊 Statistical Analysis of RED Project Data (R)

This project replicates standard **SPSS-style statistical workflows** in **R**,  
using modern R packages to achieve a clean, reproducible and well-documented analytical pipeline.

Originally inspired by work done during my first year as a **junior data analyst at Nivaga**,  
this repository demonstrates how manual SPSS analyses can be fully automated in R  
using `tidyverse`, `broom`, and `rstatix`.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to explore **socio-demographic patterns** and  
**project support characteristics** based on two datasets from the *RED* project.

---

### Statistical methods applied:
- 🧮 **Chi-square test** — Relationship between gender and support outcome
- 📈 **Independent samples t-test / Wilcoxon** — Age difference by support completion
- 📊 **ANOVA / Welch ANOVA** — Total support amount across target groups
- 📐 **Effect size estimation** — Cramér’s V, Cohen’s d, η², ω²
- 🔍 **Assumption checks and diagnostics** — Normality, variance, residuals, visualization
